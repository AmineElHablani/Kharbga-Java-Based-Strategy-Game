# Kharbga-Java-Based-Strategy-Game


### Overview

Kharbga is a strategic player vs. player (PvP) game inspired by a traditional childhood game played with stones in my neighborhood. Designed for two players, each controls three soldiers with the goal of aligning them. While Kharbga shares similarities with Tic-Tac-Toe, it offers a unique, more competitive, and intelligent twist. The game features sound effects and music to enhance the overall playing experience.
